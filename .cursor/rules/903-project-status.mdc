# Project Status Documentation Standards

<version>2.0.0</version>

## Requirements

- Maintain simple, focused project status information
- Track completed work and future tasks clearly
- Use straightforward language without agile terminology
- Update status documents as significant changes occur

## Structure

The project status documentation should be maintained in `docs/project-status/` with the following files:

### Required Files

#### 1. `status.md`

Central file documenting the overall project status with the following sections:

- **Current Status**: Brief overview of the project's current state
- **Recently Completed Features**: Bulleted list of recently completed work
- **In Progress**: Work that is currently being implemented
- **System Health**: Simple metrics on test coverage, issues, and build status
- **Notes**: Additional relevant information about the system
- **Last Updated**: Date timestamp

#### 2. `todo.md`

Organized list of future work items by timeframe:

- **Short-term Tasks**: To be completed in the next 1-2 months
- **Medium-term Tasks**: Planned for the next 3-6 months
- **Long-term Tasks**: Future development ideas
- **Recently Completed**: Finished items (kept for reference)

Each todo item should be a clear, action-oriented description using markdown checkboxes:
- `- [ ]` for incomplete items
- `- [x]` for completed items

### Updating Approach

- Update `status.md` when significant features are completed or system status changes
- Update `todo.md` as tasks are completed or new tasks are identified
- Keep the documentation simple and focused on what matters

## Markdown Format Guidelines

- Use `h1` for file titles
- Use `h2` for main sections
- Use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for incomplete todo items
- Use checked boxes (`- [x]`) for completed items
- Use tables for presenting simple metrics
- Include timestamps in format YYYY-MM-DD

- Added barcode scanning functionality for quick coupon entry
- Improved mobile responsiveness 

## In Progress

- Optimizing mobile performance for the coupon list view
- Resolving minor issues with the barcode scanner

## System Health

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 80% - Good |
| Open Issues | 12 - Acceptable |
| Build Status | Passing |

## Notes

- The application currently supports English, Spanish, French, and German languages
- Local storage is used for data persistence

Status update:
Things are going ok but we have some problems with the API.
John is working on it.
Hopefully done by next week.

No structure, lacks clear sections, and missing current status.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** - Focus on what's important without excessive detail
2. **Update regularly** - Ensure information stays current and relevant 
3. **Prioritize clearly** - Group tasks by timeframe (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
4. **Track completions** - Keep a record of recently completed work
5. **Use plain language** - Avoid jargon and complex terminology
