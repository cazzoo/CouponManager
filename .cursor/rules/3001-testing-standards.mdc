# Testing Standards

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- Apply when writing or modifying test files
- Focus on maintaining code quality through comprehensive testing
- Prioritize clear, maintainable, and meaningful tests
- Ensure test coverage meets minimum requirements
- All tests should be run using pnpm commands from the project root

## Requirements

### Test Execution
- Run tests using pnpm commands from the project root directory:
  - `pnpm test` - Run all tests
  - `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode during development
  - `pnpm test:coverage` - Generate coverage reports
- Never prepend commands with directory changes (e.g., use `pnpm test` not `cd path/to/project && pnpm test`)
- Regularly run tests during development to catch issues early

### Coverage Requirements
- Maintain a minimum of 80% code coverage across the codebase
- Coverage requirements apply to:
  - 80% statement coverage
  - 80% branch coverage
  - 80% function coverage
  - 80% line coverage
- Run coverage reports regularly with `pnpm test:coverage`
- Address any coverage drops in pull requests
