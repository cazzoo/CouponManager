# Project Status Documentation

This directory contains simplified project status documentation for the CouponManager project.

## Overview

The project status documentation provides a clear view of:

- Current project status
- Completed features
- In-progress work
- Future development plans
- Known issues and problems

## Documents

The project status documentation consists of three main files:

1. **status.md** - Current project status and recently completed features
2. **todo.md** - List of upcoming and future development tasks
3. **issues.md** - Known issues, bugs, and problems to be addressed

## How to Use These Documents

### Updating Status

1. Edit `status.md` when major features are completed
2. Include:
   - Current status summary
   - Recently completed features
   - In-progress work
   - System health metrics

### Updating Todo Items

1. Edit `todo.md` to:
   - Add new tasks to the appropriate timeframe section
   - Mark completed tasks with [x]
   - Move completed tasks to the "Recently Completed" section

### Tracking Issues

1. Edit `issues.md` to:
   - Add new issues as they are discovered
   - Categorize by priority (Top, Medium, Low)
   - Move resolved issues to "Recently Resolved"
   - Remove old resolved issues after a month

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** - Focus on what's important without excessive detail
2. **Update regularly** - Ensure information stays current and relevant
3. **Prioritize clearly** - Group tasks by timeframe and issues by priority
4. **Track completions** - Keep a record of recently completed work
5. **Document issues** - Record all known issues with enough detail to understand the problem
