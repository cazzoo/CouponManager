# Project Status Documentation

This directory contains simplified project status documentation for the CouponManager project.

## Overview

The project status documentation provides a clear view of:

- Current project status
- Completed features
- In-progress work
- Future development plans

## Documents

The project status documentation consists of two main files:

1. **status.md** - Current project status and recently completed features
2. **todo.md** - List of upcoming and future development tasks

## How to Use These Documents

### Updating Status

1. Edit `status.md` when major features are completed
2. Include:
   - Current status summary
   - Recently completed features
   - In-progress work
   - System health metrics

### Updating Todo Items

1. Edit `todo.md` to:
   - Add new tasks to the appropriate timeframe section
   - Mark completed tasks with [x]
   - Move completed tasks to the "Recently Completed" section

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** - Focus on what's important without excessive detail
2. **Update regularly** - Ensure information stays current and relevant
3. **Prioritize clearly** - Group tasks by timeframe (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
4. **Track completions** - Keep a record of recently completed work

This simplified approach removes complex agile terminology and streamlines project tracking to just what's needed.
