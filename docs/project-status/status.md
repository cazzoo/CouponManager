# CouponManager Project Status

Last Updated: 2023-03-03 by @project-lead

## Current Status: ON TRACK

### Summary

The CouponManager project is currently on track with all major milestones. The team has successfully implemented the core features including coupon management, filtering, and barcode scanning capabilities. Mobile optimization is progressing well, though we've identified some performance improvements needed for the coupon list on lower-end devices. Test coverage has reached the target 80% threshold, and we're continuing to expand test coverage for new features.

### Recent Accomplishments

- Implemented barcode scanning feature for quick coupon entry
- Fixed responsive layout issues on smaller mobile devices
- Improved database query performance for large coupon collections
- Added multilingual support with English and Spanish translations
- Completed documentation for current features and architecture
- Integrated diagram generation into the build process

### Current Focus

The team is currently focused on:

1. Optimizing the performance of the coupon list for mobile devices
2. Completing integration testing for the barcode scanning feature
3. Implementing notification features for expiring coupons
4. Enhancing retailer statistics with visualization components
5. Expanding test coverage for edge cases
